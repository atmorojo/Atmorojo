### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**atmorojo/Atmorojo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my parents' SME business Information System.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP (especially Laravel), and how to think like a proper software engineer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on PHP based projects. I'm okay doing Indonesian translation jobs too.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a shy bear...ded guy. Sometimes I feel like I'm a turtle inside :turtle:.
